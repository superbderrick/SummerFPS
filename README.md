# SummerFPS

This is a basic fps game project using photon2 API and unity
You can learn the basic concepts of Photon, such as rooms and lobbies, and how to configure and manage game scenes
And you can know the basic FPS operation method. Shooting, character movement, character synchronization, object pooling, etc..
It's not a commercial game, I just made it to study.
